  "description": "Coulomb collisions act as friction on solar wind ions, gradually reducing the differential flows of alpha particles and proton beams during their journey from Sun to Earth. By extrapolating measured drifts to zero collisional age, we reveal the intrinsic velocity limits set by wave-particle interactions in the corona.",
