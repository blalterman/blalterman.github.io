  "description": "Alfven waves propagating through the solar wind continuously deposit energy into the plasma, accelerating it during its journey from the Sun to Earth. Speed distributions reveal that fast solar wind receives an additional 100+ km/s boost from wave forcing, explaining why observed speeds exceed predictions from thermal expansion alone.",
