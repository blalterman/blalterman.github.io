  "description": "Solar wind composition breathes in sync with the Sun's 11-year activity cycle. Fast wind from coronal holes maintains stable abundances regardless of solar activity, while slow wind abundances rise during solar maximum and crash during solar minimum\u2014with heavier elements showing stronger modulation due to gravitational settling.",
