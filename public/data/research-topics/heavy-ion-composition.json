  "description": "When normalized to their saturation points, all heavy ion species follow an identical trajectory in slow solar wind, revealing universal physics that doesn't discriminate by mass, charge, or ionization potential. Above saturation, this universality breaks down as element-specific fractionation takes over in fast wind.",
