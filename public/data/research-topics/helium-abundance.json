  "description": "Helium abundance in the solar wind varies dramatically with speed, rising from near-zero in the slowest wind to a saturation value of 4.19% above 433 km/s. This compositional fingerprint, locked in at the chromosphere, provides a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing solar wind from source regions with intermittently and continuously open magnetic field topologies.",
