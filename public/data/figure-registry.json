      "what_we_see": "A probability distribution reveals how frequently different solar wind speeds occur near Earth, displaying a distinctive double-humped shape. One peak at 355 km/s marks slow wind, another at 622 km/s marks fast wind. Colored bands overlay the data showing theoretical predictions with and without Alfven wave acceleration.",
      "the_finding": "The speed range predicted with Alfven wave acceleration (620-671 km/s) sits directly on the fast wind peak, while predictions without wave acceleration (434-554 km/s) fall into the valley between peaks. This 120 km/s gap represents the speed boost that Alfven waves provide during interplanetary transit.",
      "why_it_matters": "This resolves a decades-old puzzle: thermal expansion alone predicts speeds around 400-500 km/s, well below the 600+ km/s routinely observed in fast wind. Alfven waves continuously deposit energy during transit, particularly in wind from continuously open magnetic field regions. Measuring a parcel's Alfv\u00e9nicity reveals more about its solar origin than speed alone."

The left side displays the photosphere transitioning through the chromosphere and transition region into the corona. Three critical surfaces are marked: the chromosphere/transition region where helium abundance is set, the sonic surface where the wind becomes supersonic, and the Alfv\u00e9n surface where the wind magnetically disconnects from the Sun. Both closed magnetic loops (orange) and open field lines (red) are shown, with blue arrows illustrating solar wind acceleration.",
      "the_finding": "Helium abundance and cross helicity are physically imprinted on the solar wind at vastly different heights, yet both carry information about the source region's magnetic topology that persists all the way to Earth. Helium abundance gets locked in extremely close to the Sun\u2014in the chromosphere below 10,000 km altitude\u2014where helium ionization determines what fraction will flow into the solar wind. Cross helicity is established much higher\u2014between the sonic and Alfv\u00e9n surfaces spanning 1-20 solar radii\u2014where Alfv\u00e9n waves create the characteristic correlation between magnetic and velocity fluctuations.",
      "why_it_matters": "This framework transforms abstract plasma parameters into powerful remote sensing tools. By measuring helium abundance at Earth, we can infer whether the wind originated from regions with sufficient energy to ionize helium (open field coronal holes) versus regions where energy is insufficient (closed field loops). Similarly, cross helicity measured at 1 AU preserves information about wave generation processes in the corona. Together, these two measurements probe conditions at vastly different solar altitudes\u2014a factor of 7,000 in height\u2014constraining both the starting conditions and acceleration mechanism of the solar wind."

Transient events occupy a separate high-helium regime regardless of cross helicity.",

By measuring just two parameters in the solar wind at 1 AU, forecasters can identify the source region type and anticipate the wind's geoeffective properties.
