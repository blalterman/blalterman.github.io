The green region indicates solar wind from regions with magnetic fields that only open to interplanetary space. This solar wind is helium poor and independent of the solar wind's turbulent state. The red region on the right is from regions like coronal holes that are always open to interplanetary space. This solar wind is helium-rich solar wind with fluctuations that are typically associated with Alfv\u00e9n waves, the prototypical wave in a magnetized plasma. The red region on the top is from interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). The yellow region in the middle indicates indicates a narrow range of speeds (20 km/s wide) that has an ambiguous source. The arrow indicates that the magnetic field of the source region is more likely to be continuously open to interplanetary space. <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2508.20391\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">From Alterman & D'Amicis (2025), arXiv e-prints</a>."
