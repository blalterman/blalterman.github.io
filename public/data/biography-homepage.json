    "Since humans first looked to the stars, we have asked, \"Are we alone?\"",
    "The closest exoplanet to Earth, Proxima Centauri b, is 4.2 light-years away. Riding the fastest spaceship humans have ever built, it would take us over 6600 years—over 200 generations—to travel there. With current technology, no expedition would survive that journey. So how can we know if there is other life in the universe? By understanding how stars create habitable zones—starting with the one star-planet system where we know life exists: our Sun and Earth.",
    "I lead collaborative research into the solar wind—the stream of charged particles our Sun continuously emits—building teams and infrastructure that study how stars sustain life across timescales from seconds to decades. Through systematic approaches that transcend individual careers, we're creating the foundations to answer humanity's oldest question."
