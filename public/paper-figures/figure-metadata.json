This suggests that the impact of gravitational settling at the Sun on heavy ions changes with solar activity. In fast wind, the correlations are weak, but we can't tell if this is because the time period of our observations is too short or there is no correlation between fast wind abundances and solar activity.",

The solar wind can't achieve the fastest, non-transient speeds observed near Earth ($v_\\\\mathrm{fast}$) without continued acceleration once it leaves the Sun. This acceleration is likely driven by Alfvén waves as they dissipate during the solar wind's transit through interplantery space. The intermediate range of speeds ($v_\\\\mathrm{IP}$) likely corresponds to solar wind from solar sources like coronal holes for which the energy in the Alfvénic fluctuations is too low to accelerate it to the fastest, non-transient speeds observed near Earth.",

The red region on the right is from regions like coronal holes that are always open to interplanetary space. This solar wind is helium-rich solar wind with fluctuations that are typically associated with Alfvén waves, the prototypical wave in a magnetized plasma. The red region on the top is from interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). The yellow region in the middle indicates indicates a narrow range of speeds (20 km/s wide) that has an ambiguous source. The arrow indicates that the magnetic field of the source region is more likely to be continuously open to interplanetary space.",
