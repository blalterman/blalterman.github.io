    "Since humans first looked to the stars, we have asked, \"Are we alone?\"",
    "The closest exoplanet to Earth, Proxima Centauri b, is 4.2 light-years away. Riding the fastest spaceship humans have ever built, it would take us over 6600 years—over 200 generations—to travel there. But for billions of years, life on Earth has orbited a star we can observe, measure, and study—a star whose light reaches us in eight minutes, whose particles wash over our planet daily—our Sun. No single instrument, no single career, can capture what we need to know to understand it. The questions we must answer span timescales from seconds to decades: How does the solar wind vary from moment to moment? How does it evolve over solar cycles? How does it shape the space where Earth—and life—exists? Understanding our Sun requires us to work together—building collaborative systems where diverse expertise and multi-generational efforts reveal what no individual could discover.",
    "I study that star. My teams and I trace the solar wind, the river of charged particles our Sun sends into space. We ask: What does it mean for us to orbit this particular star? The answer won't directly tell us if life exists light-years away. But it shows us what it takes to be a living world and that understanding is what we'll need when we finally search beyond our own solar system."
