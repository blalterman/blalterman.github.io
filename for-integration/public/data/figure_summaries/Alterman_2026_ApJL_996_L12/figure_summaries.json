        "what_we_see": "This heat map displays helium abundance (vertical axis, 0-10%) versus solar wind speed (horizontal axis, 200-800 km/s). Colors show how frequently different combinations occur, with dark purple representing rare observations and bright red-yellow showing the most common combinations. A cyan curve traces the average helium abundance at each speed, while a green dashed line shows the overall trend. The plot reveals a distinctive two-part pattern: below about 430 km/s, helium abundance climbs steeply from near 0% to about 4%, then abruptly levels off and remains constant around 4-5% at higher speeds. This creates a sharp elbow or saturation point where the trend fundamentally changes.",
        "the_finding": "The solar wind carries two fundamentally different helium signatures. Slow solar wind (below 430 km/s) shows wildly variable helium content, ranging from essentially zero to 4%, with abundance increasing as speed increases. Fast solar wind (above 430 km/s) shows remarkably consistent helium content locked at approximately 4.2%, which is precisely half the Sun's photospheric helium abundance. This saturation point at 433 km/s marks the statistical boundary between two distinct types of solar wind sources. The steep gradient in slow wind indicates helium is being depleted or filtered during its escape from intermittently open magnetic regions. The flat gradient in fast wind suggests a stable, efficient transport mechanism from continuously open coronal holes where helium escapes at a fixed fraction of its solar abundance.",
        "why_it_matters": "This helium pattern is like a fingerprint revealing the solar wind's birthplace on the Sun. Just as different neighborhoods produce water with different mineral content, different regions of the solar corona imprint distinctive chemical signatures on the escaping solar wind. The sharp transition at 430 km/s helps scientists identify whether a particular parcel of solar wind originated from stable coronal holes or from dynamic, transient regions. Understanding these source regions is crucial for space weather prediction because different sources produce different types of magnetic storms at Earth. The fact that fast wind carries exactly half the Sun's helium abundance points to specific physical processes occurring in the chromosphere and transition region that preferentially filter helium during the wind's acceleration. This provides constraints for models of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration, two of the most fundamental unsolved problems in heliophysics. This figure provides background context from the helium saturation framework established in Paper 7 (Alterman_2025_ApJL_982_L40). For comprehensive explanation of how helium abundance saturates at 4.19% above 433 km/s and the physical mechanisms driving this transition, see Paper 7 Figure 3."

        "what_we_see": "This contour plot shows normalized cross helicity (vertical axis, 0.1-1.0) versus solar wind speed (horizontal axis, 300-800 km/s). Cross helicity measures how 'Alfv\u00e9nic' the solar wind is\u2014essentially, how purely the plasma behaves as waves traveling along magnetic field lines. A value of 1.0 means perfect Alfv\u00e9nic behavior, while lower values indicate more turbulent, mixed conditions. The rainbow colors represent probability, showing where observations cluster most frequently. A prominent black contour line marks the 0.7 level, highlighting regions with strongly Alfv\u00e9nic character. The plot shows a clear transition from mixed conditions at slower speeds (spread across all helicity values) to highly Alfv\u00e9nic conditions at faster speeds (concentrated near 1.0).",
        "the_finding": "The solar wind becomes progressively more Alfv\u00e9nic as it speeds up. At 300 km/s, observations scatter across the full range from turbulent (0.1) to Alfv\u00e9nic (0.9), with relatively uniform probability. As speed increases toward 800 km/s, the distribution narrows dramatically, with most observations clustering near perfect Alfv\u00e9nic conditions (0.9-1.0). However, even at high speeds, there remains a tail of less-Alfv\u00e9nic observations extending downward. The black contour at 0.7 cross helicity reveals that above approximately 450 km/s, the majority of solar wind is highly Alfv\u00e9nic, while below 400 km/s, Alfv\u00e9nic conditions are much rarer. This transition zone (400-500 km/s) shows the greatest diversity in wave properties.",
        "why_it_matters": "Alfv\u00e9n waves are the dominant energy transport mechanism in the solar wind, carrying energy from the Sun's corona out into interplanetary space. The strong correlation between speed and Alfv\u00e9nic character reveals that these waves don't just ride along with the solar wind\u2014they actively accelerate it. Fast solar wind is fast precisely because it carries powerful, coherent Alfv\u00e9n waves that push the plasma to higher speeds. This connection is fundamental to understanding how the Sun's corona, which is only a few million degrees, manages to accelerate the solar wind to hundreds of kilometers per second. The existence of non-Alfv\u00e9nic fast wind (the minority of observations above 500 km/s with low cross helicity) challenges the traditional picture and suggests multiple acceleration mechanisms may be at work. For space weather forecasting, Alfv\u00e9nic content determines how energy cascades to smaller scales and heats the plasma, affecting the properties of solar wind that ultimately impacts Earth's magnetosphere. This figure provides background context from the cross helicity framework established in Paper 7 (Alterman_2025_ApJL_982_L40). For comprehensive explanation of how Alfv\u00e9nic character concentrates toward unity in fast solar wind and the implications for wave-driven acceleration, see Paper 7 Figure 4."

        "what_we_see": "This classification diagram combines cross helicity (horizontal axis, 0.0-1.0) and helium abundance (vertical axis, 0-10%) to categorize different types of solar wind into distinct colored regions. The bottom region (green) is labeled 'Intermittently Open,' covering low helium abundance below about 4%. A middle band (orange) is labeled 'Mixed Source.' The upper right corner (red) shows 'cont. open' (continuously open), characterized by high helium abundance and high Alfv\u00e9nic content. The top of the plot (also red) is labeled 'Transients*' with very high helium abundance above 8-9%. Black boundary lines separate these regions, with arrows indicating 'More Open' regions. This creates a map where any solar wind observation can be plotted and immediately classified by its source type.",
        "the_finding": "Solar wind observations naturally segregate into four distinct regimes based on their helium abundance and Alfv\u00e9nic properties. The 'Intermittently Open' zone (green, bottom) encompasses solar wind from dynamic, closed-field regions like helmet streamers, showing depleted helium regardless of wave properties. The 'Continuously Open' zone (red, upper right) represents classical fast wind from coronal holes, characterized by both high helium content (around 5%) and strong Alfv\u00e9nic character (above 0.7). Between these lies the 'Mixed Source' region (orange) where wind from different origins overlaps. Most surprisingly, a distinct population appears at high helium abundance but low Alfv\u00e9nic content (upper left)\u2014these 'Transients' likely represent interplanetary coronal mass ejections and other eruptive events that carry enhanced helium without the coherent wave properties of steady coronal hole wind.",
        "why_it_matters": "This classification scheme provides scientists with a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying solar wind origins from in situ measurements, without needing to trace magnetic field lines back to the Sun. It's analogous to how forensic scientists can determine a person's geographic origin from isotope ratios in their hair\u2014the combination of helium abundance and Alfv\u00e9nic content creates a unique signature for each solar source type. This is crucial for space weather forecasting because different sources pose different threats: coronal hole wind creates recurring high-speed streams that buffet Earth's magnetosphere, while transient events can trigger severe geomagnetic storms. The large 'Mixed Source' region reveals that during intermediate speeds (around 400-500 km/s), distinguishing origins becomes ambiguous, suggesting complex interactions between different source regions or transitional solar structures like pseudostreamers. The discovery that high helium can occur without high Alfv\u00e9nic content challenges previous assumptions and suggests helium enhancement mechanisms independent of wave acceleration. This classification scheme provides background context from the source region framework established in Paper 7 (Alterman_2025_ApJL_982_L40).

      "summary": {
        "what_we_see": "This heat map displays hydrogen compressibility (vertical axis, logarithmic scale from 0.001 to 1.0) versus solar wind speed (horizontal axis, 300-800 km/s). Compressibility measures how much the hydrogen density fluctuates\u2014high values mean the density is varying a lot, while low values mean it's staying relatively constant. The rainbow colors show probability density, revealing where observations concentrate. The plot shows three distinct horizontal bands: a prominent mid-level band at compressibility around 0.1 spanning all speeds (yellow-orange, highest probability), a narrow low-compressibility band near 0.01 (cool colors), and a high-compressibility tail near 1.0 (cool colors, rare events). Notably, the probability patterns remain relatively similar across all speeds, with only subtle variations.",
        "the_finding": "Contrary to expectations, hydrogen compressibility shows surprisingly little dependence on solar wind speed. The most probable compressibility hovers around 10% (0.1) regardless of whether the wind is traveling at 300 km/s or 800 km/s. This is unexpected because Figure 2 showed that fast wind is highly Alfv\u00e9nic, and Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations are theoretically incompressible (density shouldn't change). Yet here we see significant density fluctuations even at high speeds where Alfv\u00e9nic character dominates. The distribution is remarkably steady: at any speed, you find a broad range of compressibility spanning three orders of magnitude. The median compressibility is around 0.1, with a long tail extending to highly compressible events near 1.0. The weakest hint of speed-dependence appears as slightly enhanced probability at very low compressibility for speeds above 600 km/s.",
        "why_it_matters": "This finding reveals that density fluctuations in the solar wind are controlled by different physics than the Alfv\u00e9nic wave properties shown in Figure 2. While cross helicity increases dramatically with speed, compressibility remains stubbornly independent, suggesting these are separate, decoupled processes. This challenges the traditional view that fast, Alfv\u00e9nic wind should be incompressible. The persistence of density fluctuations across all speeds indicates that compressive processes\u2014perhaps slow magnetosonic waves, pressure-balanced structures, or remnants of coronal dynamics\u2014remain important even in highly Alfv\u00e9nic plasma. For the paper's central question about helium regulation, this figure sets up the critical insight: if compressibility varies independently of speed while helium abundance depends on speed (Figure 1), then compressibility might be the hidden variable regulating helium patterns. This has practical implications for space weather because density fluctuations affect how solar wind energy couples to planetary magnetospheres and how cosmic rays propagate through the heliosphere."

        "what_we_see": "This contour plot combines three variables: solar wind speed (horizontal axis, 300-800 km/s), cross helicity (vertical axis, 0.1-0.95), and hydrogen compressibility (shown by rainbow colors). The purple curve overlaid on the plot shows the 0.7 cross helicity boundary from Figure 2, marking highly Alfv\u00e9nic conditions. The color scale uses greens and yellows for typical compressibility (around 0.1-0.2) and shifts to oranges and reds for higher compressibility (above 0.3). The plot reveals a dramatic diagonal feature: the upper-left quadrant (high cross helicity, low-to-moderate speed, around 300-400 km/s at 0.8-0.9 helicity) glows blue, indicating very low compressibility around 0.07-0.09. In contrast, the lower-left region and isolated pockets at high speeds show elevated compressibility (orange-red, 0.3-0.7).",
        "the_finding": "The relationship between Alfv\u00e9nic character and compressibility is not simple\u2014it depends critically on speed. At lower speeds (300-500 km/s), highly Alfv\u00e9nic plasma (cross helicity above 0.8) shows very low compressibility (blue colors, 0.07-0.09), exactly as theory predicts for pure Alfv\u00e9n waves. However, at high speeds (above 600 km/s), even highly Alfv\u00e9nic plasma can exhibit moderate to high compressibility. The most compressible plasma (orange-red regions) appears in two distinct zones: non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind at all speeds (bottom of the plot), and isolated pockets at very high speeds and intermediate helicity. The purple boundary line reveals that above the 0.7 cross helicity threshold, compressibility typically stays below 0.2, but with notable exceptions. The gradient is steepest in the transition zone around 400 km/s where moderate speeds meet moderate cross helicity.",
        "why_it_matters": "This figure reveals the key regulatory mechanism proposed in the paper's title: hydrogen compressibility acts differently depending on the solar wind's wave properties. The blue zone (low compressibility at high helicity and moderate speeds) likely represents textbook Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind from coronal hole boundaries\u2014highly wave-dominated but not yet accelerated to high speeds. The orange pockets at high speeds suggest compressive structures embedded within otherwise Alfv\u00e9nic fast wind, possibly representing remnant coronal structures, shocks, or local wave steepening. For helium regulation, this matters because if helium abundance correlates with compressibility (as the paper argues), then the same solar wind speed can produce different helium signatures depending on its compressive properties. This explains the puzzling gradients in helium abundance above the saturation speed shown in earlier work. Practically, this finding means space weather forecasters cannot rely on speed alone to characterize solar wind properties\u2014the combination of speed, Alfv\u00e9nic content, and compressibility together determines the plasma's behavior and impact on Earth's space environment. The complex structure revealed here suggests multiple physical processes operating simultaneously: wave acceleration, compressive heating, and possibly magnetic reconnection or turbulent cascade."

      "summary": {
        "what_we_see": "This heat map shows how wave coherence (Alfvenicity) varies across solar wind speed and helium abundance. The vertical axis spans helium from 0% to 10%; the horizontal axis covers speeds from 300 to 800 km/s. Colors encode Alfvenicity: purple-blue indicates weak wave coherence, teal-yellow shows moderate coherence, and orange-red marks strong unidirectional waves. A prominent U-shaped black contour highlights the 0.6 Alfvenicity level. This contour starts at low helium across all speeds, dips to minimum near 400 km/s, then climbs steeply to reach 8% helium at 800 km/s. Black dots mark saturation points where helium transitions from speed-dependent to speed-independent behavior. These dots cluster in a narrow diagonal band from 380 to 430 km/s, all sitting just above the 0.6 contour.",
        "the_finding": "Saturation occurs exclusively in moderately Alfvenic wind. All saturation points cluster at Alfvenicity levels of 0.6-0.7, not in extremely coherent or weakly coherent wind. This 0.6 threshold marks a critical level below which helium cannot saturate regardless of speed.\n\nThe U-shaped contour reveals that reaching this threshold requires different helium abundances at different speeds. In slow wind (300-400 km/s), even low helium (1-2%) achieves moderate Alfvenicity. In fast wind (600-800 km/s), progressively higher helium (6-9%) is needed to maintain the same 0.6 level.\n\nA crossover region at 530-560 km/s poses a puzzle: non-Alfvenic fast wind carries more helium than Alfvenic fast wind at the same speed. This contradicts the expectation that coronal-hole sources produce helium-rich wind while streamer-belt sources produce helium-poor wind.",
        "why_it_matters": "This figure overturns the assumption that Alfvenicity alone determines solar wind composition. Saturation occurs universally at Alfvenicity of 0.6, implying that extremely pure wave propagation isn't required. A threshold of 60% coherent wave propagation suffices.\n\nThis has profound implications for solar wind sources. Coronal holes typically produce Alfvenicity above 0.7, well above the saturation threshold. But active region boundaries producing wind near 0.5-0.6 sit right at the threshold. Minor variations in magnetic topology could push these sources above or below critical Alfvenicity.\n\nThe crossover zone at 530-560 km/s reveals where traditional Alfvenicity-based classification breaks down. At these speeds, you cannot distinguish source regions using wave coherence and helium alone. This ambiguity motivates introducing compressibility as a third diagnostic in subsequent figures."

The axes remain identical: helium abundance 0-10% vertically, solar wind speed 300-800 km/s horizontally. Colors now represent density fluctuation magnitude: deep blue indicates highly incompressible wind where density barely fluctuates, yellow shows moderate fluctuation levels, and orange-red marks compressible wind with substantial density variations. The color pattern reveals a striking diagonal divide. The lower-left region (slow speeds, low helium) appears predominantly blue-teal. The upper-right region (fast speeds, high helium) shifts toward orange-red. A transitional yellow band runs diagonally between them. Overlaid curves reproduce the Alfvenicity-based fits from Figure 6, allowing direct comparison.",
        "the_finding": "Helium saturation occurs exclusively in incompressible solar wind. The saturation points and the mean abundance curve all sit firmly in the blue incompressible region where density fluctuations remain below 9%. They avoid the orange compressible areas entirely.\n\nComparing to the Alfvenicity-based curves, slow wind is universally incompressible regardless of wave coherence. Above saturation, the curves diverge: Alfvenic fast wind continues through deep blue incompressible zones, while non-Alfvenic fast wind drifts toward the yellow transitional zone.\n\nThis divergence explains the crossover puzzle from Figure 6. Non-Alfvenic wind at 530-560 km/s reaches the edge of the incompressible regime where compressibility begins enhancing helium. Alfvenic wind remains deep in the incompressible zone where helium stays saturated.",
        "why_it_matters": "Compressibility, not Alfvenicity, is the primary regulator of helium saturation. You can saturate helium in moderately Alfvenic wind as long as compressibility stays below 9%. But you cannot saturate helium in compressible wind regardless of how Alfvenic it is.\n\nThis inverts the traditional paradigm. Coronal holes produce saturated wind not because they're Alfvenic, but because their open-field topology suppresses compressive fluctuations. Closed-field regions produce compressible wind because their complex geometries generate slow-mode waves and intermittent reconnection.\n\nFor space weather forecasting, this argues for using compressibility rather than Alfvenicity as the primary classifier. If you measure density fluctuations below 9%, you're observing coronal-hole-type wind regardless of wave coherence. If fluctuations exceed 15%, you're seeing streamer-belt or coronal mass ejection wind even if Alfvenicity happens to be high."

The restricted view reveals fine structure invisible at full scale. Individual compressibility contours appear as distinct color bands rather than blended gradients. The saturation points trace a diagonal path from approximately 410 km/s at 3.9% helium to 430 km/s at 4.4% helium. The critical feature is how the 8.5% compressibility contour interacts with these points. This contour runs nearly parallel to the saturation-point diagonal, crossing the cluster around 420-430 km/s. The contour gradient noticeably changes across the saturation zone: gentler slope below saturation, steeper slope above.",
        "the_finding": "The saturation points straddle the 8.5% compressibility contour rather than occurring at a single fixed level. Different wave-coherence quantiles saturate at compressibilities spanning roughly 8.2-8.8%. This narrow spread (less than 1% density fluctuation difference) confirms saturation is tightly coupled to a specific incompressibility threshold.\n\nThe inflection in the contour gradient indicates a fundamental change in the speed-helium-compressibility relationship. Below saturation, increasing speed at fixed compressibility requires only modest helium increases. Above saturation, maintaining fixed compressibility while increasing speed requires progressively larger helium increases.\n\nThe 530-560 km/s crossover occurs precisely where both abundance curves cross from the 8.5% zone into the 9.0-9.5% zone. At this transition, non-Alfvenic wind climbs faster in helium than Alfvenic wind, allowing it to temporarily carry more helium despite weaker wave coherence.",
        "why_it_matters": "This zoomed view provides smoking-gun evidence that compressibility actively regulates helium saturation. The contour gradient changes slope precisely where the abundance curves also change slope, suggesting a causal relationship.\n\nSaturation occurs when solar wind crosses below a critical compressibility threshold. Below this threshold, helium and hydrogen achieve pressure equilibrium. Above it, compressive fluctuations continually perturb this equilibrium.\n\nThe narrow 8.2-8.8% compressibility spread identifies 8.5% density fluctuations as a universal critical threshold. This threshold operates regardless of speed, wave coherence, or source region. It likely corresponds to where slow-mode waves can no longer propagate, or where compressive-to-Alfvenic energy ratio drops below a critical value.\n\nFor space weather, this provides a practical forecasting threshold. If real-time monitors detect density fluctuations dropping below 8.5%, helium will saturate and remain at 4% for several hours."

These exhibit clear saturation behavior. The top 3-4 curves (compressible, fluctuations above 15%) peel away from this bundle, continuing to climb steeply with no plateau. They show no saturation within the analyzed speed range.",

The species reach pressure equilibrium, fixing the helium-to-hydrogen ratio at 4% regardless of further speed increases. Above this threshold, helium couples kinetically to hydrogen, responding to each compression and rarefaction event.\n\nThe universal slow-wind gradient across all incompressible quantiles reveals that slow-wind helium abundance is set purely by speed. Compressibility plays no role below saturation.

        "what_we_see": "This normalized companion to Figure 9 rescales all 15 curves to their individual saturation points. Both axes are now dimensionless ratios: horizontal shows speed divided by saturation speed (ranging from 0.5 to 2.0), vertical shows abundance divided by saturation abundance (spanning 0.0 to 1.4). By construction, every incompressible curve's saturation point maps to coordinate (1.0, 1.0). The normalized plot reveals a striking pattern. All 12 incompressible curves collapse onto a single master curve. The collapsed region shows extraordinary tightness: less than 5% vertical spread across the entire normalized speed range. In contrast, the four compressible pink curves peel away, reaching 30-40% above their nominal saturation values at the highest normalized speeds.",
        "the_finding": "Incompressible solar wind exhibits universal helium behavior. Once you normalize by saturation parameters, the functional form is identical across all compressibility levels spanning a factor of 2.3 range.\n\nThis universality manifests three ways. First, the slow-wind portion shows all curves overlaying precisely with normalized gradient of 2.5. Second, the fast-wind portion shows near-horizontality for deeply incompressible wind. Third, the spread at fixed normalized speed organizes systematically by compressibility level.\n\nCompressible curves don't collapse. Each follows its own trajectory rather than overlaying the others, indicating non-universal physics. There's no single master function describing helium behavior for compressible wind.",
        "why_it_matters": "The existence of a universal master curve implies scale-invariant physics. The same dimensionless equation applies whether analyzing polar coronal hole wind or transitional equatorial wind. This universality signals a fundamental thermodynamic relationship.\n\nOnce solar wind becomes incompressible, helium and hydrogen reach common temperature and pressure through efficient collisional coupling. The resulting density ratio depends only on normalized speed, not on detailed turbulence properties.\n\nThe 2.5 normalized slow-wind gradient provides a quantitative target for acceleration models. The near-horizontal fast-wind plateau confirms nearly adiabatic acceleration: helium is fully coupled to hydrogen and participates equally in acceleration.\n\nFor forecasting, the universal curve enables prediction: measure speed and compressibility at Earth, identify position on the master curve, and predict helium abundance without directly measuring composition. The breakdown of universality in compressible wind makes those predictions inherently less reliable."

        "what_we_see": "This two-panel figure tracks how the transition between slow and fast solar wind shifts as you bin solar wind by its compressibility (measured as hydrogen density fluctuations from 7% to 65%). Panel (a) plots saturation speed (vertical axis, 405-440 km/s) while panel (b) plots saturation abundance (vertical axis, 3.7-4.3% helium relative to hydrogen), both versus hydrogen compressibility (horizontal axis). Each data point is a colored square or circle representing one compressibility bin, with colors ranging from dark blue/purple (low cross helicity, non-Alfv\u00e9nic) through greens and yellows to magenta/pink (high cross helicity, Alfv\u00e9nic). Points are connected by dotted lines to guide the eye, with error bars showing uncertainties, and a semitransparent gray envelope traces the full uncertainty range. Three horizontal cyan bands in each panel mark reference values from Paper I's cross helicity analysis: low \u03c3_c (bottom), mid \u03c3_c (middle), and high \u03c3 c (top). Panel labels identify which plasma parameter bins are shown: (a) uses v_SW bins, (b) uses A_He bins. The critical threshold at |\u03b4n_H/n_H| = 0.085 is marked with blue-edged circles; compressible quantiles (>0.15) appear as pink squares.",
        "the_finding": "The saturation point\u2014where solar wind transitions from slow to fast based on helium abundance climbing with speed\u2014isn't fixed but instead depends dramatically on compressibility. For incompressible solar wind (left side, compressibility <10%), saturation speed sits around 428-430 km/s and saturation abundance near 3.85-3.90%, values that cluster tightly within the cyan bands corresponding to Alfv\u00e9nic wind from Paper I. But as compressibility increases beyond 15% (the incompressible-to-compressible boundary), both saturation parameters plunge: saturation speed drops to 408-420 km/s while saturation abundance falls to 4.1-4.2%. The most striking feature is the dramatic jump that occurs right at the 8.5% compressibility threshold (blue-edged markers): this represents a critical transition where the solar wind character fundamentally changes. The color progression reveals that incompressible bins (circles, left) map predominantly to high cross helicity (greens/cyans/magentas), while compressible bins (squares, right) map to lower cross helicity (oranges/reds/purples), confirming the anticorrelation between Alfv\u00e9nicity and compressibility. The three cyan reference bands show that incompressible saturation points match Paper I's high-\u03c3_c values almost perfectly, but compressible bins fall systematically below all three reference levels.",
        "why_it_matters": "This figure delivers the central revelation of the paper: there is no single, universal transition speed separating fast from slow solar wind. The transition depends on whether you're looking at incompressible Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations (waves propagating along magnetic field lines) or compressible non-Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations (density variations). The ~20-25 km/s downward shift in saturation speed for compressible wind means that using any fixed speed threshold (like 400 km/s or 450 km/s) to separate fast/slow will systematically mis-classify a significant fraction of observations\u2014you'll label some slow, compressible wind as \"fast\" and some fast, incompressible wind as \"slow.\" The tight clustering of incompressible points within the cyan bands validates Paper I's cross helicity approach for Alfv\u00e9nic wind, where magnetic waves dominate and compressibility is negligible. But the compressible subset reveals a hidden population: solar wind at intermediate speeds (~435-508 km/s based on the range of saturation speeds) that exhibits enhanced helium abundance not because it comes from open coronal holes but because compressive fluctuations (possibly pressure-balanced structures, partial-density structures, or slow-mode waves) are amplifying helium in non-Alfv\u00e9nic plasma. The fact that saturation abundance also shifts (rising to 4.1-4.2% in compressible bins) suggests these compressive fluctuations don't just change the speed threshold\u2014they fundamentally alter the relationship between helium and speed. For solar wind source region identification, this means you cannot reliably trace plasma back to open versus closed sources using speed alone or even speed plus helium; you must also account for compressibility. The 8.5% compressibility threshold (blue edges) emerges as a critical diagnostic boundary: below this, you're seeing Alfv\u00e9nic processes; above this, compressive physics dominates the helium-speed relationship."

        "what_we_see": "This scatter plot with logarithmic horizontal axis shows how the helium-speed gradient above the saturation point (the \"saturation slope\" measuring how fast helium abundance climbs with increasing speed in the fast wind regime) varies with hydrogen compressibility. The vertical axis spans 0 to 7 in units of 10^-3 % per km/s, while the horizontal axis runs logarithmically from 10^-2 (1%) to 10^0 (100%) compressibility. Data appear as colored circles for incompressible bins (<15% compressibility) and colored squares for compressible bins (>15%), with colors matching Figure 11's cross helicity scheme: blues/cyans for Alfv\u00e9nic, oranges/reds/magentas for non-Alfv\u00e9nic. The incompressible circles cluster tightly near slope ~1.0 across the left portion (0.01 to 0.1 compressibility), barely rising above the 1.0 horizontal line. Beyond compressibility ~0.15 (marked by a vertical dotted line at 10^-1), four pink squares with magenta fill erupt upward in a steep diagonal trend, climbing from slope ~2.5 at 0.15 to slope ~6.5 at 0.65 compressibility. A dashed black guideline traces this explosive rise, and gray shading envelops the incompressible plateau for visual reference.",
        "the_finding": "The saturation slope splits solar wind into two radically different regimes. For incompressible solar wind (circles, compressibility <15%), the saturation slope holds nearly constant at 0.84 \u00b1 0.06 \u00d7 10^-3 % per km/s\u2014meaning helium abundance increases gently and uniformly as speed rises above the saturation threshold, consistent with standard fast wind from stable coronal holes. This flat behavior persists across an order of magnitude variation in compressibility (from 1% to 10%), demonstrating that Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations don't significantly alter the helium-speed relationship in open solar wind. But the moment compressibility crosses 15%, the slope detonates: it climbs exponentially (note the log scale on the horizontal axis makes this a power-law rise) to 2.7 \u00d7 10^-3 at 15% compressibility, then 4.0 \u00d7 10^-3 around 25%, and finally peaks at 6.5 \u00d7 10^-3 near 65% compressibility\u2014nearly eight times steeper than incompressible wind. The four compressible squares form a tight, monotonically increasing sequence along the dashed guideline, showing this isn't scatter but a systematic relationship. The transition at 15% compressibility (vertical dotted line) appears as a sharp boundary: to the left, slopes are flat and stable; to the right, slopes skyrocket.",
        "why_it_matters": "This explosive increase in saturation slope for compressible wind explains the paradox from Paper I: why non-Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind showed anomalously high helium abundances at fast speeds (>545 km/s). The steep slope means that for every kilometer-per-second increase in speed above the saturation point in compressible plasma, helium abundance jumps by 6-7 times more than it would in incompressible Alfv\u00e9nic wind. This creates a feedback loop: compressive fluctuations lower the saturation speed threshold (Figure 11), and then above that threshold, helium climbs so rapidly with speed that even moderately fast compressible wind (~500-550 km/s) ends up with helium abundances exceeding what you'd expect from truly fast Alfv\u00e9nic wind at the same speeds. The physical implication is profound: compressibility isn't just a passive tracer but actively regulates helium abundance, possibly through pressure-balanced structures (PBSs) where density and temperature anticorrelate, or partial-density structures (PDSs) where density variations decouple from temperature, or slow-mode waves that compress plasma along field lines. The flat slope in incompressible wind (circles) confirms that Alfv\u00e9nic processes yield predictable, linear helium-speed scaling\u2014exactly what you'd expect from wind originating in magnetically open coronal holes where gravitational settling and Coulomb drag set helium abundance at the base and acceleration doesn't fractionate it further. For identifying solar wind sources, this means you cannot use helium abundance at a given speed to infer the source region without first knowing compressibility: a 500 km/s Alfv\u00e9nic wind sample might have 4.0% helium, while a 500 km/s compressible sample could have 5.5% helium purely due to the steeper slope, yet both might originate from open sources. The 15% compressibility threshold emerges as the critical boundary distinguishing these two populations, and the monotonic rise beyond it (captured by the dashed guideline) suggests compressibility fraction itself acts as a tuning parameter controlling how strongly helium abundance couples to speed variations."

        "what_we_see": "This three-panel vertical stack shows how the three saturation parameters (slope, speed, abundance) vary with cross helicity when solar wind is filtered by different compressibility thresholds. Each panel spans cross helicity |\u03c3_c| from 0.0 to 1.0 (horizontal axis). Panel (a) plots saturation slope (0-10 in units of 10^-3 % per km/s), panel (b) plots saturation speed (400-470 km/s), and panel (c) plots saturation abundance (3.4-4.2% helium). Five curves overlay each panel: the solid blue line with shading shows the full dataset (all compressibilities); three dashed/dotted lines in red, green, and orange show incompressible subsets with maximum compressibilities of <8.5%, <10%, and <15% respectively (labeled in panel a); and a dotted purple line shows the compressible subset (>15%). A gray horizontal line in each panel marks the reference value from the full dataset. Cyan bands highlight three critical cross helicity ranges (Low \u03c3_c, Mid \u03c3_c, High \u03c3_c) corresponding to Paper I's classification scheme. The incompressible lines (red/green/orange) cluster tightly together and sit well below the full dataset in panel (a), cluster around 418-430 km/s in panel (b), and overlap near 4.1-4.2% in panel (c). The compressible purple line diverges wildly in panel (a), peaking at slope ~9 near \u03c3_c = 0.2, oscillates erratically in panel (b) around 440-450 km/s, and drops to 3.6-3.8% in panel (c).",
        "the_finding": "Filtering by compressibility transforms chaotic variation into clean, stable trends. In the full dataset (solid blue), saturation slope climbs from ~4 at low cross helicity to ~2 at high cross helicity (panel a)\u2014the \"wrong\" direction from Paper I's expectation that Alfv\u00e9nic wind should have consistent behavior. But when you isolate incompressible wind (<8.5%, <10%, <15%: red/green/orange dashed lines), all three curves collapse onto nearly identical tracks sitting at slope ~2.5-3.5 across all cross helicities, with only a gentle decline as \u03c3_c increases. The compressible subset (purple dotted) reveals why: it explodes to slope ~9 at low cross helicity (\u03c3_c ~ 0.2), then crashes back down, creating wild swings that pull the full dataset's blue curve upward at non-Alfv\u00e9nic conditions. Panel (b) shows the speed story: incompressible subsets yield saturation speeds clustering tightly around 425-430 km/s for mid-to-high \u03c3_c, while the compressible subset oscillates between 435-455 km/s, sometimes exceeding incompressible values by 20 km/s. Panel (c) flips the pattern: incompressible abundances sit 0.2-0.4% higher than compressible abundances across most cross helicities, with incompressible near 4.1% and compressible near 3.7-3.8%. Most tellingly, the three incompressible thresholds (red/green/orange) produce nearly indistinguishable curves in all three panels\u2014meaning the exact cutoff (8.5% vs 10% vs 15%) doesn't matter much, as long as you exclude compressible fluctuations. The gray reference lines (full dataset) sit consistently offset from the incompressible cluster, showing that mixing compressible and incompressible wind systematically biases saturation parameters.",
        "why_it_matters": "This figure proves that compressibility acts as a confounding variable: when you analyze solar wind without accounting for density fluctuations, you're averaging together two fundamentally different populations (Alfv\u00e9nic and compressible) that respond oppositely to cross helicity, obscuring the clean relationships that exist within each population. The tight convergence of the three incompressible curves (red/green/orange) demonstrates that incompressible Alfv\u00e9nic wind exhibits the consistent, predictable behavior Paper I expected: saturation slopes stay near 2.5-3.5 \u00d7 10^-3, saturation speeds cluster around 425-430 km/s, and saturation abundances hold near 4.1%\u2014all nearly independent of which incompressible threshold you use. This validates 15% compressibility as a robust boundary: it cleanly separates the two populations without requiring fine-tuning. The compressible subset's erratic behavior (purple dotted)\u2014especially the slope explosion to 9 \u00d7 10^-3 at low \u03c3_c\u2014reveals that compressive fluctuations introduce a new physical regime where helium abundance couples strongly to speed variations in ways that don't occur in Alfv\u00e9nic wind. The fact that compressible wind shows lower saturation abundance (panel c) but higher saturation slope (panel a) than incompressible wind means compressible plasma starts with less helium at moderate speeds but gains helium faster as speed increases, eventually crossing over incompressible wind's helium content at high speeds\u2014exactly the crossover behavior seen in Figure 6's paradox. For source region classification, this has immediate practical implications: if you want to use saturation parameters to identify whether solar wind originates from open or closed magnetic sources, you must first filter by compressibility; otherwise, the compressible contamination (purple) will pull your saturation speed and slope estimates away from the true Alfv\u00e9nic values (red/green/orange), leading you to misclassify source regions. The gray lines show how large this bias is: the full dataset (blue) overestimates saturation slope by ~50-100% and misplaces saturation speed by ~5-10 km/s compared to the incompressible truth. The three cyan bands highlighting Low/Mid/High \u03c3_c emphasize that this compressibility filtering works consistently across the full range of Alfv\u00e9nic character."

        "what_we_see": "This histogram-style probability density plot shows the distribution of solar wind speeds observed at 1 au during solar minima 23 and 24, with colored horizontal bars marking nine different speed ranges identified across this paper and related studies. The black curve traces probability density (vertical axis, logarithmic from 10^-5 to 10^-2) versus solar wind speed (horizontal axis, 300-800 km/s), peaking around 400-420 km/s and exhibiting a broad tail stretching toward 600 km/s before dropping sharply. Below the main curve, colored horizontal segments indicate distinct speed intervals: purple and orange for slow/fast wind boundaries from various definitions (v_slow, v_n, v_\u03b4n, v_\u03b4n'), cyan for intermediate regimes (v_\u03c3, v_i, v_K), and blue/green for specialized boundaries (v_0, v_fast). Each segment is labeled and positioned vertically to avoid overlap (vertical position is for clarity only, not data). The segments cluster heavily in the 400-500 km/s range, with v_\u03b4n' (the compressible saturation speed range) spanning 435-508 km/s, sitting right in the middle of this congested zone.",
        "the_finding": "The compressible wind's fast-slow transition (v_\u03b4n' = 435-508 km/s, orange bar) falls squarely within the messy 400-500 km/s region where multiple ad hoc speed thresholds overlap\u2014the very range where researchers have historically struggled to cleanly separate fast from slow wind. This isn't coincidence: it's evidence that compressive fluctuations are a major reason why no single speed threshold works universally. The incompressible transition (v_\u03b4n = 417-436 km/s, green bar) sits at the distribution's peak, corresponding to the most commonly observed speeds during solar minimum and overlapping with the classical \"slow wind\" upper boundary. The spread between v_\u03b4n (incompressible) and v_\u03b4n' (compressible) spans 91 km/s (417-508 km/s), covering nearly the entire contested fast-slow boundary region. Other specialized speeds cluster nearby: v_0 (the speed at which A_He equals the photospheric ratio, 410-432 km/s), v_n (the speed where helium gradient changes, ~420 km/s), and v_i (intermediate Alfv\u00e9nic wind, 470 km/s). Meanwhile, the clearly slow wind (v_slow, purple, ~350 km/s) and clearly fast wind (v_fast, blue, ~650 km/s, and v_K which extends to very high speeds) sit well outside this congested zone. The probability density curve shows that speeds in the v_\u03b4n to v_\u03b4n' range (400-500 km/s) represent roughly 30-40% of all solar minimum observations (based on the area under the black curve), making this compressibility-driven ambiguity a first-order effect, not a rare edge case.",
        "why_it_matters": "This figure synthesizes a key conclusion: the reason the solar wind community has never agreed on a single speed threshold to separate fast from slow is that speed alone is insufficient\u2014you're trying to draw one line through a two-dimensional distribution (speed and compressibility). The v_\u03b4n' bar proves that compressible solar wind undergoes its slow-to-fast transition 20-70 km/s faster than incompressible wind, meaning any fixed threshold between 417-508 km/s will correctly classify one population while misclassifying the other. The heavy overlap of colored bars in the 400-500 km/s zone reveals that this region contains a mixture: Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind accelerating through its saturation point (v_\u03b4n), compressible wind also transitioning (v_\u03b4n'), intermediate Alfv\u00e9nic wind from specific source structures (v_i), and wind with photospheric helium ratios (v_0). The fact that v_\u03b4n' extends all the way to 508 km/s\u2014well into what many studies would call \"fast wind\"\u2014shows that compressible fluctuations can elevate helium abundance and alter saturation behavior even at speeds traditionally associated with coronal hole sources. For practical space weather applications, this means speed-based forecasting schemes that assume all wind above 450 km/s behaves like fast coronal hole wind will fail when compressible structures dominate: you might see 480 km/s wind with high helium (compressible, v_\u03b4n' regime) that behaves very differently from 480 km/s Alfv\u00e9nic coronal hole wind. The position of v_\u03b4n near the distribution's peak (most probable speed) also explains why slow wind properties vary so much in the literature: you're sampling right at the transition boundary, so small changes in how you define \"slow\" (by speed, helium, or cross helicity) will shift your sample between pre-saturation and post-saturation regimes. The fact that this analysis required nine distinct speed ranges to capture the complexity\u2014and all nine fit within a ~200 km/s window\u2014underscores that solar wind classification cannot be reduced to a simple fast/slow dichotomy; you need multi-parameter diagnostics (speed + helium + cross helicity + compressibility) to correctly identify source regions and predict plasma behavior at 1 au."

All four panels share the same axes and color-coding scheme but show different statistical properties of helium abundance A_He.

Black contour lines in all panels mark A_He = 3.82% (the minimum saturation abundance from Paper I and this work), creating closed loops and boundaries that segment the parameter space. A horizontal black line at compressibility ~0.75-0.85 appears in panels (a) and (c), separating high-compressibility (top) from moderate-compressibility (below) regimes. Colors in panels (a-c) range from deep blue (low helium, 0.6-2.6%) through cyan and yellow-green (moderate, 3.4-4.2%) to orange and red (high, 4.6-5.0%). Panel (d) uses purple/blue (low variability, 0-30%) through yellow (moderate, 50-70%) to orange/red (high, 80-100%). All contours are smoothed with a 1\u03c3 Gaussian kernel for visual clarity.",
        "the_finding": "Two distinct helium-rich regions emerge, each operating by different physics. In the incompressible, highly Alfv\u00e9nic corner (bottom right: low compressibility <10%, high cross helicity >0.8), mean helium (panel a) reaches 4.2-4.6% and sits in the yellow-orange zone, with the 90% quantile (panel b) climbing to 7-9% (red), while variability (panel d) shows moderate values around 50-70% (yellow-orange). This region corresponds to fast Alfv\u00e9nic wind from stable coronal holes where helium abundance is elevated and somewhat variable but confined to a predictable range. In stark contrast, the compressible, non-Alfv\u00e9nic region (upper left: compressibility >20%, cross helicity <0.4) shows lower mean helium around 3.6-3.8% (panel a, cyan-blue), but variability (panel d) explodes to 80-100% (deep red/magenta), meaning helium swings wildly from sample to sample. The 90% quantile in this compressible regime (panel b) also reaches 7-9%, indicating that while average helium is lower, peak values match the Alfv\u00e9nic regime\u2014it's the scatter that differs. The 10% quantile (panel c) reveals the floor: in Alfv\u00e9nic wind it sits around 1.4-1.8% (orange-red), but in compressible wind it drops to 0.8-1.2% (blue-cyan), showing compressible wind can exhibit much lower minimum helium. The 3.82% contour (black lines) forms a closed loop in the middle of the parameter space, encircling intermediate conditions (\u03c3_c ~ 0.4-0.7, compressibility ~ 0.1-0.3), demonstrating that saturation-level helium occurs across a broad swath of conditions, not just in one source type. Critically, the contours bend and warp systematically: moving right (increasing \u03c3_c) at fixed compressibility increases mean helium (panel a colors shift from blue to yellow), while moving up (increasing compressibility) at fixed \u03c3_c decreases mean helium but increases variability.",
        "why_it_matters": "This figure reveals that compressibility plays a dual, paradoxical role in helium abundance. In Alfv\u00e9nic wind (bottom right), helium is high and moderately variable because you're sampling a relatively homogeneous source population (open coronal holes) where gravitational settling and Coulomb drag set helium to a consistent elevated level, with variations driven by source region structure and expansion geometry. In compressible wind (upper left), helium is lower on average but wildly variable because you're mixing multiple source types\u2014some samples come from partially open structures with enhanced compressibility but normal helium, others come from pressure-balanced or partial-density structures where compression locally boosts helium to Alfv\u00e9nic-like levels (7-9% in panel b), while still others come from streamer-belt remnants with depleted helium (0.8-1.2% in panel c). The extreme variability (80-100% in panel d) is the smoking gun: it proves compressible wind is not a single source type but a heterogeneous mixture. The fact that the 90% quantile (panel b) reaches comparable values in both regimes (7-9%) explains Figure 6's paradox: when you average over all cross helicities without filtering by compressibility, occasional compressible samples with boosted helium (from the 90% tail) pull the non-Alfv\u00e9nic mean upward, creating the illusion that non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind systematically has higher helium at fast speeds\u2014but it's really a selection effect from mixing stable Alfv\u00e9nic wind (consistent high helium) with variable compressible wind (occasional very high helium). The 3.82% contour looping through the middle shows that you can find saturation-level helium across a wide range of Alfv\u00e9nic and compressive conditions, meaning saturation abundance alone cannot uniquely identify solar wind type. For source region mapping, panels (a) and (d) together provide a diagnostic: high mean + moderate variability = open coronal hole (Alfv\u00e9nic); low mean + extreme variability = mixed sources with compressive structures (non-Alfv\u00e9nic). The systematic trends in the contours\u2014helium increasing with \u03c3_c, decreasing with compressibility\u2014also validate that these two parameters are independent axes: cross helicity captures Alfv\u00e9nic wave content (magnetic topology), while compressibility captures density structure physics (pressure balance, shocks, slow modes), and you need both to characterize the plasma fully."

This fast wind region extends down to moderate Alfv\u00e9nicity (|\u03c3c| ~ 0.6) but requires elevated compressibility. The bulk of the parameter space, especially at low compressibility (|\u03b4nH/nH| < 0.1), shows slower speeds of 380-420 km s\u207b\u00b9 (green-yellow colors) regardless of Alfv\u00e9nicity. The 433 and 450 km s\u207b\u00b9 contours trace steep diagonal boundaries, indicating that achieving these saturation speeds requires specific combinations of compressibility and Alfv\u00e9nicity rather than either property alone. Panel (b) shows that speed variability is relatively uniform (around -40 to -45%) across most of the parameter space, with slightly enhanced variability in the fast wind region and some reduction in the most Alfv\u00e9nic, incompressible solar wind. The symmetry of variability across different plasma regimes suggests that speed fluctuations are not the primary driver distinguishing plasma types.",

The steep contours indicate that the saturation point is highly sensitive to both quantities simultaneously\u2014neglecting compressibility when analyzing Alfv\u00e9nic properties (or vice versa) mixes fundamentally different plasma populations. The overlap of speeds across different (|\u03c3c|, |\u03b4nH/nH|) regions supports the inference that solar wind from nominally \"open\" source regions can span a range of speeds depending on local compressive fluctuations, consistent with the Alfv\u00e9n-wave-poor intermediate population identified in B. Alterman (2025). This challenges the traditional fast/slow solar wind dichotomy and suggests that source region topology alone does not determine observed speeds at 1 AU."

The crescent shape centered near the saturation abundance As ~ 4% indicates that this is the natural state for the least disturbed solar wind from continuously open sources. However, the 75th percentile results demonstrate that 25% of observations in this supposedly incompressible regime actually exceed the 0.15 threshold, implying that compressive fluctuations regularly intrude into Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind. This explains why the saturation points in Paper I showed enhanced helium abundance gradients at high speeds even in highly Alfv\u00e9nic wind\u2014those averages included a significant tail of compressible events. The dramatic increase in compressibility at enhanced AHe > 6% confirms that the helium enrichment above saturation is associated with compressive processes, not purely Alfv\u00e9nic transport. The contour patterns suggest that helium abundance and compressibility are coupled in non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind but decorrelated in the Alfv\u00e9nic crescent, indicating fundamentally different physical mechanisms operating in these regimes."

The broad |\u03c3c| maximum at AHe ~ 4-6% for incompressible wind indicates that this is the natural equilibrium state for Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind from open sources. The fact that As remains fixed near 4% across incompressible quantiles but shifts for compressible wind suggests that the saturation abundance is an intrinsic property of Alfv\u00e9nic transport that becomes masked when compressive fluctuations are present. The smooth progression of curves with increasing compressibility provides a quantitative mapping tool: for any observed (|\u03c3c|, AHe) pair, this figure estimates the typical compressibility level, revealing that Paper I's analysis implicitly averaged over a range of |\u03b4nH/nH| values when binning by |\u03c3c| alone. The convergence of incompressible curves near their maximum also explains why Paper I found consistent saturation behavior at |\u03c3c| ~ 0.6\u2014this represents the natural peak Alfv\u00e9nicity for incompressible wind, not an arbitrary threshold."

The systematic increase in vs with decreasing compressibility (440\u2192470 km s\u207b\u00b9) indicates that the saturation transition occurs at progressively higher speeds when the plasma is more Alfv\u00e9nic and incompressible, suggesting that Alfv\u00e9nic acceleration mechanisms can push the slow-to-fast transition to higher speeds. The clustering of vs values around 450-480 km s\u207b\u00b9 at |\u03c3c| ~ 0.60-0.65 for incompressible wind confirms that this is the characteristic state for the slow-fast transition in undisturbed solar wind from open sources. The flat |\u03c3c|(vsw) response in compressible wind implies that compressive fluctuations are not primarily speed-dependent but rather reflect source region properties or localized disturbances that affect slow and fast wind equally. This mapping enables converting between the vs-based saturation analysis (this work) and the |\u03c3c|-based analysis (Paper I), resolving the apparent paradox that fast wind showed enhanced helium gradients even in highly Alfv\u00e9nic bins."

In contrast, the steep rise of compressibility with speed in non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind suggests that fast non-Alfv\u00e9nic streams are intrinsically more compressible, possibly due to stream interactions or source region dynamics. The observation that compressibility increases above 560 km s\u207b\u00b9 even in highly Alfv\u00e9nic bins (where |\u03b4nH/nH| rises from ~0.08 to ~0.12-0.15) explains the Paper I paradox: the enhanced helium abundance gradient at speeds above vs in the most Alfv\u00e9nic quantiles is driven by this modest but systematic increase in compressive fluctuations at high speeds.

Below the saturation abundance (slow wind), compressibility decreases with increasing helium as the plasma transitions from closed-field sources to open-field sources. Above saturation (fast wind), compressibility increases again, but the rate of increase depends strongly on Alfv\u00e9nicity. Non-Alfv\u00e9nic fast wind becomes highly compressible, while Alfv\u00e9nic fast wind remains relatively smooth. This suggests that in fast wind from magnetically open sources, Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations suppress compressibility, keeping the flow more laminar.

The divergence between Alfv\u00e9nic and non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind at high helium abundances demonstrates that magnetic field topology and wave activity fundamentally regulate solar wind turbulence. The convergence of all curves near 5% helium suggests this represents a special equilibrium state in solar wind acceleration and heating processes, potentially linked to the saturation mechanism that limits helium abundance to roughly 50% of photospheric values."

This transition is remarkably abrupt, occurring almost entirely between |\u03c3c| values of 0.6 and 0.08. In panel (b), the saturation abundance follows the opposite pattern, decreasing from about 4.2% in low-Alfv\u00e9nicity wind to 3.8% in high-Alfv\u00e9nicity wind. Again, most of the change occurs over a narrow Alfv\u00e9nicity range. The blue reference bands show that the low-Alfv\u00e9nicity regime (bottom bands) has slow saturation speeds but high saturation abundances, while the mid and high-Alfv\u00e9nicity regimes (upper bands) cluster together at faster speeds and lower abundances.\n\nThese opposing trends reveal that solar wind source regions with different magnetic properties produce fundamentally different slow/fast wind transitions. Non-Alfv\u00e9nic sources (likely intermittently open or \"closed\" magnetic topologies) allow helium to build up to higher abundances before the wind accelerates to fast speeds, resulting in a high-abundance, low-speed saturation point. Alfv\u00e9nic sources (continuously open magnetic topologies) reach the fast wind regime at lower helium abundances but higher speeds. The sharpness of both transitions around |\u03c3c| \u2248 0.1-0.6 suggests a critical threshold where the magnetic topology fundamentally changes the acceleration and compositional fractionation processes. The fact that compressibility can be mapped to Alfv\u00e9nicity validates that these properties are intrinsically linked through the underlying magnetic field structure.",
        "the_finding": "- Saturation speed decreases sharply from 433 km/s to 410 km/s as Alfv\u00e9nicity decreases from |\u03c3c| = 0.6 to |\u03c3c| = 0.08\n\n- Saturation abundance shows opposite trend, increasing from 3.8% to 4.2% as Alfv\u00e9nicity decreases\n\n- Incompressible solar wind (mapped from compressibility quantiles) consistently shows |\u03c3c| \u2248 0.6 regardless of whether mapped using speed or abundance\n\n- Compressible solar wind maps to |\u03c3c| < 0.06 when using speed and |\u03c3c| < 0.6 when using abundance\n\n- The transitions in both saturation speed and abundance are concentrated in a narrow Alfv\u00e9nicity range between 0.1 and 0.6",
        "why_it_matters": "This figure demonstrates that compressibility, measured independently through hydrogen density fluctuations, maps systematically onto Alfv\u00e9nicity measured through magnetic field and velocity correlations. This validates that both quantities probe the same underlying physical property: the magnetic topology of solar wind source regions. The opposing dependencies of saturation speed and abundance on Alfv\u00e9nicity reveal different acceleration and fractionation mechanisms in open versus closed magnetic structures. In Alfv\u00e9nic wind from continuously open fields, efficient acceleration reaches high speeds before much helium accumulates. In non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind from intermittently open regions, slower acceleration allows more helium buildup before reaching fast wind speeds. The clustering of mid and high-Alfv\u00e9nicity saturation points suggests a characteristic threshold around |\u03c3c| = 0.6 that may represent the transition from partially open to fully open magnetic topologies, corresponding to the boundary between slow Alfv\u00e9nic Slow Wind (ASW) and classical fast wind."

Panel (a) maps compressibility to Alfv\u00e9nicity using the saturation speed, while panel (b) uses the saturation abundance for mapping. Both axes show saturation slope in units of percent helium per kilometer per second\u2014essentially how quickly helium abundance rises as wind speed increases above the saturation point. Markers are mostly unfilled except for the critical |\u03b4nH/nH| = 0.085 compressibility level (shown filled). Colors span from magenta (highly compressible, |\u03b4nH/nH| \u2248 0.15) at one extreme to blue (incompressible, |\u03b4nH/nH| \u2248 0.02) at the other. Dotted lines connect markers to guide the eye.\n\nBoth panels reveal a striking bimodal distribution. In panel (a), most of the compressible solar wind (magenta markers) clusters tightly at low Alfv\u00e9nicity (|\u03c3c| \u2248 0.48-0.52) with steep saturation slopes around 0.006% per km/s. These slopes then plummet rapidly as Alfv\u00e9nicity increases, with all incompressible cases (blue through yellow markers) converging to a nearly flat slope of about 0.001% per km/s at |\u03c3c| = 0.60. Panel (b) shows similar behavior but with the transition spread over a wider Alfv\u00e9nicity range: compressible wind spans |\u03c3c| \u2248 0.5-0.58 with steep slopes, while incompressible wind reaches |\u03c3c| \u2248 0.65 with flat slopes. The filled markers tracking the intermediate compressibility level show a smooth transition between these two regimes in both panels.\n\nThis bimodal pattern reveals that only compressible, non-Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind shows substantial helium enrichment with increasing speed above saturation. In this regime, every 100 km/s increase in wind speed corresponds to roughly 0.6% increase in helium abundance\u2014a strong compositional gradient. In contrast, Alfv\u00e9nic wind shows almost no helium enrichment with speed above saturation (slopes near 0.001% per km/s mean helium is essentially constant). The fact that the transition occurs around |\u03c3c| = 0.6 in both panels, despite using different mapping methods, confirms this represents a real physical threshold. Below this threshold, magnetic field structure allows continued fractionation and helium enrichment in fast wind. Above it, helium abundance is locked near the saturation value regardless of speed, suggesting different source heating or acceleration mechanisms.",

        "why_it_matters": "The saturation slope quantifies how helium composition evolves in the fast solar wind regime. The bimodal distribution demonstrates that Alfv\u00e9nic wind from open magnetic fields maintains nearly constant helium abundance across all speeds above saturation, while non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind continues to fractionate and enrich helium as speed increases. This difference likely reflects distinct acceleration mechanisms: Alfv\u00e9nic wind may be accelerated primarily by wave pressure that affects hydrogen and helium equally, preserving the saturation composition, while non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind may experience thermal or pressure-driven acceleration that preferentially accelerates lighter hydrogen, leaving helium relatively behind and creating an apparent enhancement. The consistency of the |\u03c3c| \u2248 0.6 threshold across both mapping methods validates that Alfv\u00e9nicity is the fundamental controlling parameter. This threshold may mark the transition from partially open coronal structures that allow continued fractionation to fully open structures where wave-driven acceleration dominates."

Colors range from blue (highly Alfv\u00e9nic, |\u03c3c| \u2248 0.0) through cyan, green, yellow, orange, to magenta (non-Alfv\u00e9nic, |\u03c3c| \u2248 1.0). All markers are filled, connected by dotted lines, and surrounded by error bars and a semitransparent gray uncertainty envelope. Horizontal cyan bands mark distinct Alfv\u00e9nicity regimes (Low, Mid, High |\u03c3c|) defined in the companion Paper I. The x-axis spans compressibility from highly incompressible (0.07) to moderately compressible (0.14), capturing the range where saturation transitions occur.\n\nPanel (a) shows saturation speed clustering tightly around 430 km/s for low compressibility (|\u03b4nH/nH| < 0.085), with all Mid and High Alfv\u00e9nicity markers (cyan through orange) confined to this region. As compressibility increases beyond 0.085, saturation speed drops precipitously, with Low Alfv\u00e9nicity markers (magenta) extending down to 410 km/s at the highest compressibilities. The transition is sharp and systematic, with speed decreasing roughly 20 km/s over a compressibility increase of just 0.04. Panel (b) reveals a strikingly linear relationship between saturation abundance and compressibility: abundance decreases from about 4.2% at the highest compressibility to 3.8% at the lowest, with a fitted slope of -8.6% per unit compressibility. The Mid Alfv\u00e9nicity markers form a tight cluster along this trend, while Low and High Alfv\u00e9nicity markers show more scatter but follow the same general relationship.\n\nTogether, the panels demonstrate that compressibility is a more fundamental organizing parameter than Alfv\u00e9nicity for the saturation abundance. While Figure 22 showed how saturation properties vary with Alfv\u00e9nicity, this figure reveals that when organized by compressibility instead, a cleaner relationship emerges for abundance. The linear trend in panel (b) suggests a direct physical coupling: more compressible plasma reaches saturation at higher helium abundances, while incompressible plasma saturates at lower abundances. The clustering of Mid and High Alfv\u00e9nicity cases at low compressibility (< 0.085) indicates these regimes naturally produce similar plasma properties. The fact that no saturation points appear at very high compressibility (> 0.14) suggests this represents an upper physical limit on compressibility in the slow-to-fast wind transition.",

The linear relationship between saturation abundance and compressibility (panel b) suggests a direct mechanistic coupling: compressible turbulent fluctuations may enhance the gravitational settling or Coulomb drag processes that deplete helium in slow wind, requiring higher abundances before fast wind acceleration becomes efficient. The y-intercept of 4.76% represents the saturation abundance in hypothetical perfectly smooth (incompressible) solar wind, close to the observed value in highly Alfv\u00e9nic streams. The absence of saturation points at very high compressibility suggests that beyond |\u03b4nH/nH| \u2248 0.14, plasma either never reaches the fast wind regime or transitions through different mechanisms. The tight clustering of Mid Alfv\u00e9nicity cases demonstrates that this regime represents a characteristic equilibrium state for typical solar wind conditions, while Low and High Alfv\u00e9nicity regimes show more variability reflecting diverse source region properties."

        "what_we_see": "This single-panel figure plots the helium abundance in very fast solar wind (800 km/s\u2014the fastest speed analyzed) relative to the saturation abundance, showing how this enhancement ratio depends on Alfv\u00e9nicity. Each data point represents a different Alfv\u00e9nicity level, with colors transitioning from blue (highly Alfv\u00e9nic, |\u03c3c| near 0) through cyan, green, yellow, orange, to dark red and magenta (non-Alfv\u00e9nic, |\u03c3c| near 1.0). The y-axis shows abundance enhancement above saturation, where a value of 1.0 would mean helium abundance at 800 km/s equals the saturation value, while 1.4 would mean 40% enrichment. Error bars indicate uncertainties in the measurements, and a dashed black line shows a linear fit to the overall trend, which has a clear negative slope.\n\nThe data reveal a striking linear anti-correlation between Alfv\u00e9nicity and helium enhancement in fast wind. At the highest Alfv\u00e9nicity (|\u03c3c| \u2248 0.9-1.0), helium abundance in 800 km/s wind exceeds saturation by only 10-11% (ratio \u2248 1.10), shown by the dark red and magenta markers on the right. As Alfv\u00e9nicity decreases moving left across the plot, enhancement increases systematically: at moderate Alfv\u00e9nicity (|\u03c3c| \u2248 0.5, yellow markers), enhancement reaches about 24%, and at the lowest Alfv\u00e9nicity (|\u03c3c| < 0.1, dark blue markers), enhancement peaks at 37-40%. The linear fit has a slope of -0.4\u00b10.02 per unit |\u03c3c| and a y-intercept of 1.46\u00b10.02, meaning that in hypothetical perfectly non-Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind (|\u03c3c| = 0), helium would be enhanced by 46% above saturation.\n\nThis linear trend creates an apparent paradox that motivates the entire paper. Fast solar wind above saturation is expected to come from magnetically open coronal holes, which typically produce Alfv\u00e9nic, incompressible plasma. Yet this figure shows that if the fastest wind were non-Alfv\u00e9nic, helium would reach 46% above saturation\u2014combined with the saturation value itself being about 50% of photospheric abundance, this would imply helium approaching 73% of photospheric values, contradicting the robust observational finding that solar wind helium never exceeds 50% of photospheric abundance across the solar cycle. The resolution, as explored in the full paper, is that compressibility and Alfv\u00e9nicity are tightly coupled: non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind is also compressible, and this compressibility regulates helium abundance through mechanisms that prevent the extrapolated 46% enhancement from being realized in actual observations.",
        "the_finding": "- Helium enhancement above saturation in 800 km/s wind decreases linearly with increasing Alfv\u00e9nicity, from 40% enhancement in non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind to 10% in highly Alfv\u00e9nic wind\n\n- Linear fit yields slope of -0.4\u00b10.02 and y-intercept of 1.46\u00b10.02, indicating 46% theoretical enhancement in perfectly non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind\n\n- Most Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind (|\u03c3c| > 0.9) shows helium abundance only 10% above saturation even at 800 km/s\n\n- The enhancement varies by a factor of 4 across the Alfv\u00e9nicity range (10% to 40%)\n\n- The systematic trend suggests fundamental coupling between magnetic topology, wave activity, and compositional fractionation",
        "why_it_matters": "This figure exposes a critical tension in solar wind physics: extrapolating the observed trend suggests non-Alfv\u00e9nic fast wind should have helium abundances exceeding the known 50% photospheric limit. The resolution lies in recognizing that non-Alfv\u00e9nic and Alfv\u00e9nic solar wind represent fundamentally different source regions with different magnetic topologies. Alfv\u00e9nic fast wind from continuously open coronal holes undergoes efficient wave-driven acceleration that reaches high speeds with minimal additional helium fractionation above saturation, resulting in low enhancement. Non-Alfv\u00e9nic wind from intermittently open or complex magnetic structures experiences continued compositional evolution even above saturation, but the compressibility associated with non-Alfv\u00e9nic conditions ultimately limits how much helium can accumulate through regulatory mechanisms explored in the paper. This figure demonstrates that source region magnetic topology, as encoded in Alfv\u00e9nicity and compressibility, fundamentally controls not just the saturation point but the entire compositional evolution of solar wind from slow to fast regimes."
